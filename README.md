# Advanced Python

This repository houses the notes and the code I developed working through the 'Advanced Python' course on the LinkedIn Learning platform.


This repository contains two main folders:
1. notes
2. code


The code and notes files that have the same name correspond, and should be read in conjunction with one another.
